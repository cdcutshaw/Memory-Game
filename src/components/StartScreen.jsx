        <p>You have fallen victim to the twisted experiments of the mad scientist Singed, transformed into a mindless, raging beast. To reclaim your memories and return to your true self, you must conquer this memory game.</p>
        <p>How to play: Select a new character each turn to earn points. But bewareâ€”choosing the same character twice will end the game. Test your memory and see if you can break free from Singed's grasp!</p>
